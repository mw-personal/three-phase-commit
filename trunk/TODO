- Bugs in basic 3pc protocol.
	- do we check if the message we receive is the message we are expecting
- election protocol
	- requires modifying participant
	- needs a rnaking!
- testing!
	- does our basic message passing system work?
- easier way to instantiate a protocol
	- using the config file?
- processes need to be able to take an initial state
	- processes can begin with aborting everything.
	- do they only abort the first transaction or all subsequent transactions?
- extend messages
	- we need more messages
	- should messages take a UID?
- heartbeat!
- need a way to force processes to fail!
- is the setup really extensible?
	- we should attempt to implement 2pc
- do participants need to know the current coordinator?
	- or do they get this from the protocol?
- how do participants begin the protocol?
- is a participant in his own addressbook?
- need to test timeout
- after death, must flush tcp


Schedule::
	- handle config file.
		- important for launching tests
		- generate random config files
	- default "bank account state"
	- launching participants on different threads
	- message passing - 
		- test message passing
		- test message queue after failure
		
	- heartbeat 
		- failure detection
	- refine "addressBook"
	- forcing proccess fail!
